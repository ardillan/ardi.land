Octopath Traveller ha sido un juego que compré por mi cariño a los píxeles.

The game puts players in the role of one of eight adventurers, each of whom begins their journey in different ways. Each character comes from different parts of the world, each of which determines their job or attribute. Each character has a unique Path Ability command that can be used when interacting with NPCs that are divided into two categories: Noble, the ability's effectiveness dependent by the character's level or amount of in-game currency, and Rogue, which has a risk of its user losing credibility upon other NPCs. For example, Olberic and H'aanit can challenge characters, Cyrus and Alfyn can inquire about certain bits of information, Tressa and Therion can acquire items, and Ophilia and Primrose can guide NPCs and use them as guest summons.
